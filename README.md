# ccom-main-effects
Main-effect analyses for the Couples' Communication study. These analyses examine the effect of our experimental manipulation on thirteen dependent variables, including:

-Observer ratings of partners interactions together during a discussion about points of disagreement in their relationship, and a discussion about qualities they appreciate in each other. Raters scored partners' positivity, negativity, unconstructiveness, and positive mood.

-Partners' positive feelings about each other after the disagreement discussion

-Partners' aggressive impulses toward one another after the disagreement discussion

-Partners' change in affect during the disagreement discussion,

-Partners' pin-insertion in a voodoo doll, as a behavioral measure of aggression (Dewall et al., 2013)

The 'main effects' .r and .md files show the code and output for running the analyses. The 'figures' .r file shows the code used to generate the figure below, showing the significant effects from the analyses.
